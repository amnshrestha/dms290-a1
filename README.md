## Javascript
The Javascript in `script.js` is activated when the `scroll-up` element is clicked. It returns the page to scroll position `0` with the `smooth` option enabled. This feature is not yet supported in Safari. I also added a click listener for the "book a trip" button, that redirects the user to a new webpage.

## Changes made for assignment 2

Markup : -Layout
            -Added animation so that the title appears first, then the two images
            -This brings a smooth introduction to the place with the title, the words "The world's happiest city" and then two images
        -Embellishments
            -Changed the font size of section-header; added shadow, padding and z-index to section-header; reduced opacity of background image
            -This makes the section-header more visible against the background
