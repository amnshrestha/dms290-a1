## Javascript
The Javascript in `script.js` is activated when the `scroll-up` element is clicked. It returns the page to scroll position `0` with the `smooth` option enabled. This feature is not yet supported in Safari. I also added a click listener for the "book a trip" button, that redirects the user to a new webpage.
